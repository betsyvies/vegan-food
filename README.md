# Welcome Vegan Food

Vegan Food is a vegan food chain. It's open 24hrs a day.

Our 24hr service proposal has been very well received and, to continue 
growing, we developed a system that helps us taking orders from our 
customers in an effective way.

## Login credentials

There are two users, an administrator, and a collaborator. These users have 
access to different views and features.

It's important to say that the administrator creates, deletes, and updates 
only products and new users. On the other hand, the collaborator creates, 
deletes and updates only the orders.
